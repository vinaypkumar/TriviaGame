# TriviaGame
A trivia game based on dinosaurs. Upon page load, users see a whole lot of nothing. When ready, they press the "Begin" button, and must answer as many questions as they can before time runs out, at which point their total score percentage is displayed to them. The user may also end early if they either finish before time runs out or just give up.
